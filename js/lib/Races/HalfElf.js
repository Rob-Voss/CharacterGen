/**
 * Half-Elves
 Half-elves are not truly an elf subrace, but they are often mistaken for elves. Half-elves usually inherit a good blend of their parentsâ€™ physical characteristics.
 Favored Class: Any. When determining whether a multiclass half-elf takes an experience point penalty, her highest-level class does not count.
 Level Adjustment: +0.

 Race Bonuses:
 +1 racial bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks.
 +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy and Gather Information checks.

 Medium: As Medium creatures, half-elves have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.
 Half-elf base land speed is 30 feet.
 Immunity to sleep spells and similar magical effects, and a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells or effects.
 Low-Light Vision: A half-elf can see twice as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination. She retains the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.
 Elven Blood: For all effects related to race, a half-elf is considered an elf.
 Automatic Languages: Common and Elven. Bonus Languages: Any (other than secret languages, such as Druidic).
